# Combat

The core is automatic ([Weapons](./weapon.md)). The player has three
manual verbs on top:

- **Dash** — contact damage + i-frames + **chain** (dash-kill recharges
  dash and refunds energy).
- **Tongue** — auto-aims the nearest edible / enemy; enemy takes damage
  and is pulled; costs energy.
- **Whip (Rabada)** — tail sweep on a dedicated button.

Combo streak (`game.combo`) climbs on kills and decays if you break off.

## Whip (Rabada)

`Player._whip_hit`. Manual tail strike. Buttons: **middle click / Q**,
P2 **RAlt**, gamepad **Y**. Costs `C.WHIP_COST`, cooldown
`Player.whip_cooldown`.

### How the tail moves (`Player._whip_arc`)

The **tail** sweeps, not the body. Since [Spine](./spine.md) is
follow-the-leader, the only way to _steer_ it is via the head — which is
why the first two attempts missed (impulse on velocity then arc on head:
both threw the **entire body** sideways). The fix: **rebuild the rear
half's joints** from a pivot (`_whip_span`), distributing `C.WHIP_SWEEP`
degrees of curvature across all of them.

- **Ramp must be soft.** Putting the full turn in the first joint reads
  as a hinge (a "rigid piece rotating"); a quadratic ramp toward the tip
  puts ~80° in one link, above the spine's own bend limit (`bend=26`) —
  the corner beaks and the following `resolve` clamps it. A near-uniform
  ramp gives a near-circular arc — the lizard **keeps its natural
  curvature**.
- **Full-period envelope** (`sin(t*2π)`): sweeps one side, passes through
  centre, sweeps the other — one strike, in and out smoothly at zero.
- Anchor the angle on the **body** (`js[pv] - js[pv-2]`), **never on last
  frame's tail**: `spine.resolve` derives direction from previous
  positions, so anchoring on the tail feeds the curve back and the swing
  cancels to a tremor.
- The override survives to draw only because player contact is **soft** —
  the player is never pushed, so `collision.separate` skips its
  re-resolve. If contact turns hard again, this breaks.

### Hitbox = the actual joints

`spine.joints[-3:]` with an explicit reach `max_r*1.15` (the tip radius
is ~0.22 × max_r, too small). What you see is what hits; enemy head still
crits.

`whip_hits` (set, cleared on fire) = **one hit per target per swing**,
same pattern as `dash_hits`. Without it the damage-per-frame bug returns.

Hitbox uses the **same span that moves** (`_whip_span` serves both).
When only the last 3 joints were tested and the moving span grew to 6,
the tail visibly swept over the enemy without hitting.

### Tail modifiers (were cosmetic)

- **`club`** → `WHIP_CLUB_MULT` damage + `WHIP_KNOCK_CLUB` knockback +
  bigger shake.
- **`sting`** → `apply_poison`. Enemy stings `apply_slow` — the divergence
  is on purpose.

### Damage scales with Might

`_whip_hit` multiplies by `player.might`. Naked whip is weak on purpose;
the damage comes from upgrades. **Vigor** (+20%/card) and **Potência**
(DNA, +6%/level) finally improve the strike. Values: 2 naked → 5 with
club → 12 with club + Vigor + DNA.

Dash gets the same treatment (`Player.dash_damage()`): base 5 → 4, ×
`DASH_WINGS_MULT` (1.5) with Membranas, × `might`. Membranas already
improved dash speed / duration / cooldown / cost but **not** damage,
despite the card saying "stronger dash" — now it does. 4 naked → 6
with membranas → 13 with membranas + Vigor + DNA.

The calc lives in a method because there were **two** call sites reading
`C.DASH_DAMAGE` directly (enemy and nest); scaling one would skip the
other silently. See [ADR-0008](../adr/0008-might-scales-all-damage.md).

Card descriptions must tell the truth: `might` touches weapons **and**
dash **and** whip. Membranas' unkept promise went unnoticed for a long
time.

### Reach

The arc behind / beside the lizard (measured: 1-2 targets per strike),
not the whole screen. When the strike still moved the body it caught
4-5, and per-hit damage was lowered to compensate; with the tail alone
it went back near dash, and the cost is a longer cooldown.
No repeat hits on the same target (`whip_hits`), and the tail does not
hurt outside a strike.

`take_hit` **assigns** `vel`, so extra push comes **after** the call.

## Dash damage — one hit per lunge

`_collisions` runs **every frame**; while `p.dashing` (0.16 s ≈ 10
frames) the same enemy was hit 10× — **30 damage per dash instead of 3**
(60 with head crit). That, not HP balance, was the real cause of
"enemies die too easily". `Player.dash_hits` (set, cleared on dash
start) enforces one hit per target per dash; damage is `C.DASH_DAMAGE`
(5, crit 10; nest takes 2×).

**When you touch contact damage, always check if the source is
per-frame.**

## Collision: allies do not collide

`kind ∈ {player, friend}` never collide with each other
(`collision.FRIENDLY`) — fluid battles. Enemy ↔ enemy still separates
hard.

## Soft player↔enemy contact

Feedback: being pushed by every enemy felt like pinball. The player is
**never displaced**: passes through, **pushes the enemy** (full push, no
weight-by-size), and pays in **speed**. `collision.separate` accumulates
overlap depth in `creature.clog`; `Player.update` normalises, smooths
(`clog_f`, approach 9/s) and applies `C.CONTACT_DRAG`. Ignored during
dash (passing through is the point).

Enemy ↔ enemy still uses hard separation — otherwise the stacking bug
returns.

See [ADR-0006](../adr/0006-soft-player-contact.md).

### Two independent brakes that multiply

Sting slow × contact clog. Measured in a 6-enemy fight: 89% × 89% =
**80% average speed**, 40% of the time under 80%. Neither is bad alone;
together they explain "why am I slow?" — and neither had any on-screen
cue. `Player._draw_slow_mark` now draws cold rings under the body while
the slow lasts.

### Sting slow triggered even without a hit landing

`_contact` called `apply_slow` outside `hurt()`'s result — which exits
early on i-frames. So you took **50% slow with no damage number to
explain it**. Worse: duration 1.4 s vs `attack_cd` of 0.8 s — permanent
by construction. Measured: a scorpion kept the player slow **59% of the
time**. Today `hurt()` **returns whether the hit landed** and the sting
only slows on true. `STING_SLOW_TIME` (0.4) is much less than
`attack_cd`.

Third time this project trips on "effect lasts longer than the interval
that reapplies it" — Ácido, venom puddle, sting. See
[Enemy behaviors](./enemy-behaviors.md).

### Two more clog fixes

- **Prey braked like enemies.** `movers` includes prey, and the soft
  ramp fires for any non-ally pair with the player. A harmless grazer at
  30 px was leaving the player at 49% speed. Today only
  `collision.DRAGS_PLAYER` (= enemies) accumulates clog; prey still get
  pushed but do not cost speed.
- **Saturated with one enemy.** `clog` sums 5×5 sample pairs; a runner
  already hit ~25 against divisor `max_r*1.2` → binary brake
  (100% or 45%), no gradient. `C.CONTACT_FULL` (3.0) scales the divisor
  to "buried in ~3 bodies". Measured after: 1 enemy ≈ 90%, 4 ≈ 68%,
  6 ≈ 65%.
