# Camp

The physical clearing between [Rounds](./round.md). Two modes on the
same walkable state.

Constrained by [ADR-0005](../adr/0005-camp-is-a-physical-clearing.md).

## Two modes

- **`camp['mode'] = 'field'`** — WASD/stick walks around. Camera follows.
  Doors and the beetle tent are POIs the player can approach.
- **`camp['mode'] = 'shop'`** — menu open. Frozen world underneath.
  ESC / B closes the shop and drops back to field.

`app._camp_shop_open` gates whether menu input or WASD owns the frame.

## POIs in the clearing

- **Beetle tent** — the shop. Touching it opens `'shop'` mode.
  Contents: heal, max-HP, might, [Charm](./charm.md), egg. Costs rise
  per purchase. Charm is fixed at 150 pollen.
- **Three doors** — each shows a theme + bonus (heal / pollen / card).
  Crossing one commits — `_apply_route` calls `rounds.request_next(theme)`.

## Drops from the sky

Each POI **falls from `CAMP_DROP_H` above the ground** with an
ease-in that accelerates into impact. `_camp_impact` fires
shake + dust + sparks + a ring on landing. A **growing shadow** on the
ground telegraphs where it will land. Interaction is locked until the
POI touches the ground (`tent_landed` / `dr['landed']`) — entering a
mid-air door was a real bug.

## Shop is choice, not toll

Walking straight to a door and skipping the tent is legal. The tent has
to earn the visit. `reopen_cd` prevents reopening the shop on the same
step it was closed. Closing during drop-in is _not_ blocked — the pick
absorption (`self.pick`) is the only lock, and only for its ~0.36 s
window.

## No prey / projectiles cross into camp

`_enter_camp` cleans up prey, projectiles, and puddles. Clean clearing:
no stray creature frozen against a door. Prey are not updated in camp.
