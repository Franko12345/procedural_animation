"""Creature separation: stop long lizard bodies from passing through each other.

Each lizard is a long chain, so treating it as a single circle only keeps the
*heads* apart while the bodies still cross. Instead we sample several points along
every spine (head, quarters, tail) with their local body radius and push creatures
apart wherever *any* two samples overlap. A spatial hash over the samples keeps it
near-linear.

The accumulated push is applied to the creature's head (which drags the whole body
via the follow-the-leader chain), capped and eased so a tangled pile untangles over
a few frames instead of snapping. Affected spines are re-resolved so the drawn body
matches its corrected head the same frame.
