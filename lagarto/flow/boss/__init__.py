"""Boss framework (Fase 5): a phase-based attack-pattern engine layered on any
existing enemy body (``rounds._spawn_boss`` just scales up a themed species) --
so ten different "fights" can share one engine and differ only by DATA (which
patterns each phase rolls), the same split ``champions.py`` uses between
identity and mechanics.

Timeline, per boss:

    intro (invulnerable, ~1s) -> [approach -> windup -> attack -> recover] x N
        -> phase transition (invulnerable, ~1s, swaps the pattern list)
        -> ... -> death

Patterns are functions ``(boss, game, target) -> None`` that spawn Projectiles
through the existing ``game.spawn_projectile`` pipeline -- no new projectile
type, just new arrangements of the one every ranged enemy already uses. Every
pattern telegraphs (>=27 frames, drawn on screen, not just timed) before it
fires -- the phase-2 lesson ("telegrafo é tempo E visibilidade") applies here
at boss scale too.

A phase change swaps *at most two things* (its pattern list + one numeric
dial), so the player can attribute what changed instead of relearning a new
fight from scratch every threshold.
