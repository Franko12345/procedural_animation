"""Display: a fixed logical surface scaled to the window (window-size presets).

The game always draws to a logical ``C.WIDTH x C.HEIGHT`` surface. Each frame
``present()`` scales that surface onto the real window, letterboxed so the aspect
ratio is preserved in fullscreen. This is what makes 1x/2x/3x window presets
possible -- ``pygame.SCALED`` would pin the logical size to the window size.

Because the window and the logical surface no longer share coordinates, every
mouse position must go through ``to_logical()`` (aim *and* UI clicks).

    With ``C.PIXEL_SCALE`` > 1 that's flipped on purpose, and BOTH steps use
    nearest (``scale``, not ``smoothscale``): the downsample first tried
    smoothscale so it would average detail into each block, but averaging an
    already-anti-aliased scene just blurs it into soft blobs -- the chunky
    upscale after that is then blowing up a blur, not chunking up crisp
    pixels, which read as "blurred" instead of "pixel art" (feedback: not
    sharp, outlines not well-defined). Point-sampling (nearest) on the
    downsample instead picks ONE source pixel per block -- ink outlines and
    flat fills survive as solid blocks; thin diagonal edges alias/step
    instead of blurring, which IS the retro pixel-art look. Pure post-process
