"""Survivor-like auto-weapons: they fire/act on their own so the player just moves.

Each weapon is a small object with a **per-level table** (VS-style: each level does
something specific, shown on the card) and its own **animation**. Weapons scale with
the player's global stats: ``might`` (damage), ``cooldown_mult`` (rate), ``area_mult``
(size/range) and ``amount`` (+projectiles/orbitals). Archetypes: projectile, homing,
slow-projectile, damage-aura, slow-aura, knockback-aura, orbital and ground puddles.

One file per weapon, so each ``tick``, its ``levels`` table and its tuning live
together and can be retuned without touching the others. Shared machinery
(``Weapon``, ``Puddle``, ``_enemies_in``) is in `base`. The registry is assembled
here rather than in `base` because every weapon module imports `base` -- building
it there would make `base` import its own importers.
